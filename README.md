## How do I edit something on the site?

Before you even think of editing anything, check if any branches by the name of `rewrite`, `update` or alike exist.

If you'd like to edit, let's say the `Linux` selfhosting guide, there is a list of requirements you must meet before editing.

- [ ] 1. Is your edit contributing to the site? (Adding pages like "Credits" and adding yourself to it is not contributing to the website.)
- [ ] 2. Is your edit minor? (Grammar fix, rewording, etc.)
- [ ] 3. Is your edit of dire importance? (Site breaking when clicking X and Y)
- [ ] 4. Is your edit going to break the site?
- [ ] 5. Are the elements of the page you edited consistent with the rest of the website?
- [ ] 6. Are the elements of the page you edited Bootstrap?

If you meet all of the listed requirements, your next course of action is to open a pull request and edit what you wish to edit.
You are then to copy-paste the list from above and put X/leave empty where it belongs.

<br />

### Example:

#### Pull Request 31: Fixing the Linux page wording.

```md
In this Pull Request, I changed X and Y.

- [X] 1. Is your edit contributing to the site? (Adding pages like "Credits" and adding yourself to it is not contributing to the website.)
- [X] 2. Is your edit minor? (Grammar fix, rewording, etc.)
- [ ] 3. Is your edit of dire importance? (Site breaking when clicking X and Y)
- [ ] 4. Is your edit going to break the site?
- [X] 5. Are the elements of the page you edited consistent with the rest of the website?
- [X] 6. Are the elements of the page you edited Bootstrap?

[L#1](link to the commit line) - X Y Z
```
